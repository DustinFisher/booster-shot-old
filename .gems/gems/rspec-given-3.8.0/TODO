Things to do to improve the minitest integration

TODO:

* Make a separate gem for minitest (do we need one for given-core?)

DONE:

* Handle have_failed in minitest
* General cleanup making sure files go where they need.
* Implement assertion counting for minitest
* Figure out why the minitest example count is so low.
* Move stuff out of minitest_helper to appropriate file.
